Your notes are mostly accurate but need some refinements. Here are the corrections and improvements:

---

## Node.js

- **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser. It is built on the **V8 JavaScript engine** and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.

### JavaScript Characteristics:
- **JavaScript is both synchronous and asynchronous.**  
- **JavaScript is single-threaded.**  
- **JavaScript is a dynamically typed, concurrent programming language.**  

---

## What is synchronous programming?

Synchronous programming executes tasks sequentiallyâ€”one task must finish before moving to the next.

### Example:
```js
console.log(1);

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(2);
}, 0);

console.log(3);
```
**Output:**
```
1
3
2
```
*Even though `setTimeout` has `0` delay, it is asynchronous and executes later.*

---

## What is asynchronous programming?

Asynchronous programming allows tasks to run independently without blocking the execution of other tasks.

### Example:
```js
console.log(1);

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(2);
}, 0);

console.log(3);
```
**Output:**
```
1
3
2
```
*The execution of `setTimeout` is deferred, making the code non-blocking.*

---

## What is concurrent programming?

**Concurrent programming** allows multiple tasks to make progress **at the same time** but not necessarily simultaneously. JavaScript uses **event-driven concurrency**.

### Example:
```js
console.log(1);

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(2);
}, 0);

console.log(3);
```
*JavaScriptâ€™s event loop enables concurrency by handling I/O operations asynchronously while executing other tasks.*

---

## What is parallel programming?

**Parallel programming** executes multiple tasks **simultaneously** using multiple CPU cores.

- **JavaScript (Node.js) is NOT truly parallel** but uses an event loop to handle multiple tasks efficiently.
- **Parallelism occurs in worker threads or child processes, not in the main thread.**

---

## What is the Event Loop?

The **event loop** is the mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations non-blockingly.

### How it Works:
1. Executes **synchronous** code first (call stack).
2. Handles **asynchronous tasks** (callbacks, promises, timers).
3. Moves completed async tasks from the **callback queue** to the **call stack** when it's empty.

### Example:
```js
console.log("A");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("B");
}, 0);

console.log("C");
```
**Output:**
```
A
C
B
```
*Even though `setTimeout` has `0` delay, it runs after synchronous code due to the event loop.*

---

## What is a callback function?

A **callback function** is a function passed as an argument to another function and executed later.

### Example:
```js
function greet(name, callback) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name);
    callback();
}

function sayGoodbye() {
    console.log("Goodbye!");
}

greet("Vaibhav", sayGoodbye);
```
**Output:**
```
Hello, Vaibhav
Goodbye!
```

---

## What is dynamic typing?

In **dynamic typing**, the type of a variable can change at runtime.

### Example:
```js
let a = 10;  // a is a number
a = "hello"; // a is now a string

console.log(a); // Output: "hello"
```
*JavaScript determines variable types dynamically at runtime.*
